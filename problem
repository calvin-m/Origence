Develop a Microservices-Based E-commerce Platform
Objective: Design and implement a microservices-based e-commerce platform in C#.
Requirements:
Decompose the application into services such as User, Product, Order, and Payment.
Use ASP.NET Core for building the microservices.
Implement inter-service communication using gRPC or REST.
Ensure each service is independently deployable and scalable.
Implement user authentication and authorization to manage different user roles (e.g., admin, customer). 
Write unit tests to verify the functionality of each service.
Concepts to cover:
- Dependency Inject
- Logging & Exception Handling
- Mocking database calls or any external service calls
- How to change an implementation without changing the caller code, like changing a Mock implementation to a real implementation
